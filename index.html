    <h2>What is cryptocurrency circulating supply?</h2>

    <p>
        Cryptocurrency circulating supply is equivalent to outstanding shares of a publicly traded company. This metric counts the number of coins available for trade, as opposed to the number of maximum coin supply.
        The circulating supply helps us calculate the market capitalization of every coin. Additionally, regulating scarcity mitigates demand and impacts the coin’s price. Cryptocurrencies diverge in their circulating supply approaches, which is why it is important to understand these concepts.

    <h2>Circulating Supply: More Than Meets the Eye</h2>
    <p>
        Everyone knows that Bitcoin has a total maximum supply of 21M BTC. Since Bitcoin launched in 2009, miners have been gradually receiving bitcoins when processing transactions, i.e., adding them as new data blocks on the blockchain. By receiving these rewards, miners issued more BTC into circulation.
        At first, they were getting 50 BTC per transaction. After three halving events, their reward is now only 6.25 BTC. This is Bitcoin’s way of mitigating demand, by carefully managing its circulating supply. In traditional economies, central banks control the supply of currencies such as the U.S. dollar through printing of bank notes and interest rates. 
        Circulating supply, whether it is fiat money or cryptocurrency, has an important function as inflation control. In the case of Bitcoin, 19.1M BTC have been mined, which is about 91% of its total supply of 21M. However, does that mean that all of those 19.1M BTC are available for trade?
        No. Crypto wallets represent access to blockchain networks because they hold private keys to unlock that door. With the keys lost, the access is lost. In turn, those funds are irretrievable. In 2017, a Chainalysis report estimated that up to 3.79M BTC are lost, mostly forgotten on long-defunct hard drives.
        Moreover, it is estimated that Satoshi Nakamoto (Bitcoin’s creator) owns about 1M BTC, which has never been moved to a wallet/exchange. Altogether, this would place Bitcoin’s actual circulating supply at 14.3M. In turn, this gives crypto whales immense power to affect Bitcoin’s price.
        If Nakamoto, or someone who retrieves a lost private key, would suddenly release 1M BTC into circulating supply, the token’s price would fall.. That’s because there would be more Bitcoins in the market than there is demand.
